/*
- Claim reward for a loan based on loanId (use a brand new contract)
- This contract holds the reward tokens in escrow.
- There will be an allocateReward() function, only called by marketOwner, deposits tokens in escrow
- There will be a claimReward() function -> reads state of loans , only called by borrower -> withdraws tokens from escrow and makes those loans as having claimed rewards
- unallocateReward()

This contract could give out 1 OHM when someone takes out a loan (for every 1000 USDC)


    ryan ideas : 


    thinking through conditionals weâ€™d add to liquidity mining
1. the claimer could be the lender or borrower  - not yet implemented
ie we might be incentivizing one or the other, or both  (or some other address? idk a use case yet tho)
principalTokenAddress
2.ie the loan had to be made in USDC or x token
collateralTokenAddress
ie Olympus wants to incentivize holders to lock up gOHM as collateral
maxPrincipalPerCollateral
3. ie we might incentivize a collateral ratio greater than or less than some number. or this might be blank (would not use an oracle but raw units ? )

4. make sure loans are REPAID before any reward  ?
